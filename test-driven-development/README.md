# test-driven-development

A Claude Code skill for strict test-first development. Enforces the Red→Green→Refactor cycle before any production code is written, ensuring every behavior is specified by a failing test before it is implemented.

## When to Use

- Implementing any new feature or function
- Fixing a bug (write a reproducing test before applying the fix)
- Adding new behavior to existing code
- Refactoring — characterize current behavior with tests before touching anything

**When NOT to use:**
- Writing tests for already-completed code → the design forcing function is gone; load `/writing-unit-tests` instead
- Exploratory spikes where the goal is learning, not shipping

## How It Works

The skill enforces three gates, one per cycle phase:

| Phase | What you do | Gate |
|-------|------------|------|
| **RED** | Write one failing test for the next behavior | Confirm it fails for the right reason |
| **GREEN** | Write the minimum code to pass the test | Full suite must be green — no regressions |
| **REFACTOR** | Improve structure without changing behavior | Suite stays green throughout |

Repeat until the feature is complete.

## Usage

```
/test-driven-development
/test-driven-development implement the discount calculator
/test-driven-development fix the race condition in the job queue
```
